##Contributing

There are many things that we would like to improve in RetroShare, 
but that we don't, because we simply don't have enough time. 
That's why we are currently looking for some help.  
Knowledge of C++, QT and web skills will certainly be useful, 
but you don't need to be an expert. Existing RetroShare developers will 
be able to help you on these projects. 
Artwork like a logo, buttons, etc are useful too.
